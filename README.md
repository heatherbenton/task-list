## Description
Increasing my JavaScript skills is on my to-do list. So building a task list is appropriate, no?

## Usage
In Theory, this could be useful for a productivity website, a personal planner app, or just to remind yourself how many things being an adult requires of you.

## Roadmap
Building onto the UI with some CSS and increasing my knowledge with local storage in JavaScript will be put within my first five tasks on this list, for sure.
